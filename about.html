    <h1>About Rockland Remodels</h1>

    <p>Rockland Remodels is partially named after a small community located in the District of Shelburne in
      Nova Scotia, Canada. Kevin's wife, Edwina, is from this map-dot town on the eastern shores of North America.
    </p>
    <p>Kevin Moran threw himself into carpentry and construction as a young adult. He has worked all over
      the east coast, Canada and various other cities throughout the US. Rockland Remodels began in 2004 near
      central
      North Carolina. As time went on, and three children later, Kevin's children played a part in helping the
      family
      business succeed. Through hard work and word-of-mouth, Rockland Remodels has established themselves in a
      historical and thriving part of North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Alexandra Moran began working with her father in 2013 and, soon after, she received her General
      Contractors licence to help expand the abilities of the business. In 2021, Alexandra became a certified
      realtor
      and inspires to expand the capabilities of Rockland Remodels for future endeavors.</p>
